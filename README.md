# TechaCasino
A Casino bot for Twitch.tv

I created a casino in the chat room. Everyone that comes to my channel gets an allowance to gamble with. Use !inventory to see what you currently have. Use !bet to see what your current bet is or !bet [BET AMOUNT] to increase your bet. Use !play [blackjack|slots] to play blackjack or slots. Use !hit, !stand, and !doubledown when playing blackjack. You can also !buy [DRINK] from the bar and !drink [DRINK] when you want to drink it. Use !look to look around or !look [OBJECT] to look at something. I will periodically play bets for you to bet on. Use !placebet [BET NUMBER] [BETTING ON] ([WAGER) to place your bets. For example, use !placebet 1 over 20, to place a bet on bet 1 betting that it will go over and you will bet $20 on that bet. If you are feeling generous, use !give [OBJECT] to [USERNAME] to give away drinks to a user. And of course you could always just !dance if you feel like it. Remeber that this is all fake money! Have fun!
